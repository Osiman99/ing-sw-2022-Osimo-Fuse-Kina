### Windows:
To execute .jar files, you have to open the Windows Powershell (if the game doesn't work, open the Powershell as admin). It is highly recommended to set the Powershell colors to:

<b>Red</b>: 0

<b>Green</b>: 128

<b>Blue</b>: 128

or in any case some colors that show the black towers.

### Linux:
To execute .jar files, you have to open the Terminal (if the game doesn't work, open the Terminal as admin). It is highly recommended to set the Terminal colors to:

<b>Red</b>: 0

<b>Green</b>: 128

<b>Blue</b>: 128

or in any case some colors that show the black towers.

Then go to the directory where the jars are and input the following command:

#### Server jar:
java -jar server.jar

#### CLI version jar:
java -jar client.jar
